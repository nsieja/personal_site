        <h3>Things I Can Do:</h3>
        <ul id="skillList" class="grid">
          <li><b>Empower People to Perform Their Best:</b> I prioritize creating work environments where people feel heard,
            supported, and trusted. I prioritize psychological safety, remove roadblocks, and champion well-being—because 
            empowered people build better products, faster.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Lead High-Impact Projects:</b> I’ve led a variety of complex projects, managing everything from the
            acquisition of advanced technologies to multi-million-dollar nuclear system overhauls. I'm good at turning
            high-level objectives into concrete, actionable steps to help teams focus and deliver results.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Bridge Technical Work and Business Strategy:</b> I’ve tackled tough challenges in high-pressure situations
            where innovative thinking and quick decision-making were essential. Submarining refined my ability to address 
            complex technical issues efficiently. I've improved my ability to model and address business problems by continuing 
            my education formally in this area, earning certificates in "Business Ethics" from eCornell and "Understanding and 
            Solving Complex Business Problems" from the MIT Sloan School of Management Executive Education Program.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Facilitate Collaboration:</b> I confidently manage stakeholders at all levels — from technical
            experts to senior leadership - ensuring everyone is aligned and working toward the same goals. My ability to
            foster cross-functional communication has been key to the success of every project I’ve managed.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Optimize Processes:</b> I'm renlentlessly focused on execution efficiency. I focus on eliminating waste
            to ensure products and projects are delivered on time and to the highest standards. There is nothing that bothers
            me more in an organization than unnecessary administration or communication slowing down a team's work.</li>
