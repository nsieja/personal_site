        <h3>Things I Can Do:</h3>
        <ul id="skillList" class="grid">
          <li><b>Focus on Enabling People:</b> I prioritize creating work environments where people feel supported,
            heard, and
            empowered. I believe in fostering employee well-being and ensuring that teams have the resources and
            autonomy they need to succeed, which drives both performance and retention.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Lead High-Impact Projects:</b> I’ve led a variety of complex projects, managing everything from the
            acquisition of advanced technologies to multi-million-dollar nuclear system overhauls. I'm good at turning
            high-level
            objectives into concrete, actionable steps to help teams focus and deliver results.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Business and Technical Problem Solving:</b> I’ve tackled tough challenges in high-pressure,
            resource-constrained environments, where innovative thinking and quick decision-making were essential. My
            experience in submarine
            operations refined my ability to address complex technical issues efficiently. I've further improved my
            ability to model and
            address business problems by continuing my education formally in this area, earning a certificate in
            "Understanding and Solving
            Complex Business Problems" from MIT Sloan School of Management Executive Education Program.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Build and Lead High-Performance Teams:</b> I know what it takes to build teams that work well together
            and
            achieve their goals. I’ve led teams in stressful situations, creating a culture of trust, accountability,
            and
            collaboration to drive success.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Facilitate Collaboration:</b> I’m experienced in managing stakeholders at all levels—from technical
            experts
            to senior leadership—ensuring that everyone is aligned and working toward the same goals. My ability to
            foster cross-functional communication has been key to the success of every project I’ve managed.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Improve Processes:</b> I’ve consistently identified ways to optimize processes, whether improving
            quality
            assurance systems or streamlining operational workflows. I focus on eliminating inefficiencies to ensure
            that products and projects are delivered on time and to the highest standards. There is nothing that bothers
            me more in an
            organizational environment than unnecessary administration or authorization slowing down a team's work.</li>
